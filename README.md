# LearningWithMiyoshi

In the beginning, this is where I am housing much of my public materials for my advanced classes.  As time goes on, I will add more materials for more classes.

There are folders for each of the different classes that I teach.  Each class also has folders with documents that people can download.

### Note to educators

If you are an educator, feel free to use any of the materials that I have here.  It would be great if you documented your source.  (Which is why I license the repository with the MIT license.)  I have surely not just created my stuff completely from my own brain, but I do not know exactly where things come from.  I do have a resources for educators section that tries to at least document some important resources that have shaped my thinking about education and learning.
