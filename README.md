# LearningWithMiyoshi

In the beginning, this is where I am housing much of my public materials for my advanced classes.  As time goes on, I will add more materials for more classes.

There are folders for each of the different classes that I teach.  Each class also has folders with documents that people can download.

# Competency Grading

Here is a brief explanation of competency grading.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td></td>
    <td colspan="5">Level</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Element</td>
    <td>0-No Exposure<br /> - no experience or knowledge in this area</td>
    <td>1-Limited Skill<br /> - requires instruction and close supervision</td>
    <td>2-Moderately Skilled<br /> - can complete the job with limited supervision</td>
    <td>3-Skilled<br /> - can work independently with no supervision</td>
    <td>4-Highly Skilled<br /> - can teach others the skill and/or content</td>
  </tr>
</table>

### Note to educators

If you are an educator, feel free to use any of the materials that I have here.  It would be great if you documented your source.  (Which is why I license the repository with the MIT license.)  I have surely not just created my stuff completely from my own brain, but I do not know exactly where things come from.  I do have a resources for educators section that tries to at least document some important resources that have shaped my thinking about education and learning.
