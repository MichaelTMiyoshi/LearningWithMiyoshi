# AP Computer Science

There are no practice exams, but there are some resources here.  The "homework" assignments for the class are housed in [JavaWithMiyoshi](https://github.com/MichaelTMiyoshi/JavaWithMiyoshi), so I will not repeat them here as I would only like to change things in one repository.

So what will you find here?  Look at the chart below to find out.
