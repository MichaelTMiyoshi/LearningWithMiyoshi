# Geek Pamphlet - Leadership

What kind of a geek do you want to be?  Create a 3-fold pamphlet telling your audience how to become your kind of geek.  (By the way, a geek, to my way of thinking, is anybody who is passionate about some area where they are either an expert already or are becoming an expert.

Requirements (each of the requirements below is worth 1/8 of the total points):

1.	Create a three-fold pamphlet about the kind of geek you would like to be;
2.	Explain what the geek does (general & specific);
3.	Explain the path to becoming the specific type of geek you think you want to be;
4.	Tell what kind of education you need to enter the field;
5.	Tell where you can get the education you need (at least 2 choices) to enter the field;
6.	Tell what paths are available after you are experienced in the field (after 5-10 years of work experience);
7.	Include pictures relevant to the career choice;
8.	Include websites where people can find out more (since it will be printed, make sure that your URL actually shows up);
