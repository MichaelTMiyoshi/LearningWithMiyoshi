# Inquiry and Thank you Letter - Leadership

The inquiry and thank-you letters are an important part of the leadership portfolio.  (Note that it says AND, which means you need to do both to fulfill the requirements of this activity/assignment.  What you need to do is find a job/career in which you are interested or have an interest in pursuing.  Then find a company that employs that type of people.  It is best if you can identify a human resources person as a contact.  Then write a letter that requests the following information:

* What coursework you should take in high school.
* Whether any degrees and/or certificates need to be attained.
* Whether they offer any internships.

Write a thank you letter right away that you can use when they send you information.  Keep this as a draft incase they do not respond.  After you get a response, edit the response letter and send it.

The letters and responses will be added to a notebook of these letters.  (Former letters can be used as guides to your letter.)
