# Common Documents

This folder contains documents that are common to the different classes.

There are two different example design document templates (and examples using those templates).  I like them both as they are organized and make it easy to see the different goals and accomplishments.  The other thing that these students do is that they define MEASURABLE goals and how to measure accomplishment.  These examples are used with permission of the two respective students.

A big thank you to my students Cait and Mia.  (By the way, this does not count as using your first names in class while you are still not graduated.)
