These two letters are for students who are currently failing the class.

Students who are currently failing, but plan to pass should use the document I am failing letter.docx.  Those who plan to fail by not completing the final work for the class should use the I have failed letter.docx.  These letters are to be filled out, printed, and signed by the student.  They should be delivered to the student's parent/guardian for recognition and support of the student in his/her choice.
